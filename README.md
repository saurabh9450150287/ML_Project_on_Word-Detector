# ML_Project_on_Word-Detector
##Introduction 
In this project we detect the words in an image and make bounding boxes around those words.
This is done using OpenCV to detect text in images using the EAST text detector.

## EAST Text Detector

We call the algorithm “EAST” because it’s an: Efficient and Accurate Scene Text detection pipeline.
The EAST pipeline is capable of predicting words and lines of text at arbitrary orientations
To build and train such a deep learning model, the EAST method utilizes novel, carefully designed loss functions.
